**********Abalone Age Prediction and Analysis**********

Various methods were employed to predict the age of abalone using the given variables.
The root mean squared error was the primary metric with which performance evaluation was done.

The results showed that the best models could predict the age of abalone with an error of approximately 2 years.

abalone.mat contains the imported data.
network.mat contains a very simple pre-trained network for ANN_self.m (to simulate results at the time of running).
mlr.m uses multiple linear regression to predict the age of abalone.
ANN.m and ANN_self.m use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to do the same.
pc_analysis provides visualisation and some insight into the variables
abalone.names and abalone.data contain the original explanations and data from the creators of the original dataset respectively.

Additional explanation can be found within the scripts themselves.


The dataset was retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
